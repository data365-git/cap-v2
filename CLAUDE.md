# cap-v2 — Claude Code instructions

## Testing rule

A test MUST fail when the feature is broken. Never modify the app at runtime, weaken assertions, or add fake/always-pass scripts just to make a test green.

## E2E tests

- Framework: Playwright (Chromium, headless)
- Config: `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` — targets `http://localhost:3001`, reuses the running dev server
- Test files: `apps/web/e2e/`
- Run: `pnpm --filter @cap/web exec playwright test` (or `pnpm --filter @cap/web run test:e2e`)
- The dev server must already be running on port 3001 before executing tests
